# Introduction
Hi there! Welcome to my FPV Setup repository. This repository is purely for going over the FPV setup that I use every day. If you have ever wondered about the gear that I run and why I run it then this is the place for you!

***Disclaimer - I am by no means ever implying or saying that you should run this gear beacuse it's the best. This what I prefer to use for my type of flying and what I'm most comfortable with using. With that being said, enjoy!***

# Start Here
Half way through making this guide I realized that half of the people that click on this probably came just for the setup and do not care about why I use the gear that I use. So with that being said, for those folks I will go ahead and keep it simple down below, if you wish to read up more on the gear that I run that feel free to scroll down below this however I won't bore you anymore.

# Quad Setup
At this time of making this, I currently fly a 5" ImpulseRC Apex as my daily driver. I've only ever owned 5" quads and the Apex has been my most favorite frame out of all the ones I've tried. I've flown a CL1 VS, QAV-S JB, Ummagawd Moongoat and the Apex. Between all of them the Apex has been the most reliable and sturdiest frame that I've used out of all of them. Not only that but It's also the easiest frame to tune out of all the frames above.

The Apex is equipped with the T-Motor Pacer 2505 1850Kv Motor. More on that later, at the heart of the frame is a T-Motor F55 Pro II 4in1 ESC paired with a Kiss V2 FC.
